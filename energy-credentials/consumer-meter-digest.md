# Consumer Meter Digest Credential

The **Consumer Meter Digest** is a W3C Verifiable Credential 2.0 issued by a DISCOM, on consumer demand, that carries the consumer's own meter readings — either raw `MeterData/v0.6` profiles or derived summaries — in a form the consumer can hold in their wallet and share with any third party. It is the credential behind the [Consumer Meter Digest use case](../use-cases/consumer-meter-digest/README.md).

> **Status — draft.** The envelope, `meterReference`, `period`, `granularity`, and `readings` blocks are stable. The `summary` taxonomy is being formalised.
>
> The `readings` block carries [`MeterData`](../schemas/MeterData/README.md) profile shapes (`INTERVAL`, `DAILY`, `MONTHLY`, …; current schema is `v0.6`). `MeterData` supersedes the earlier `IES_Report` working name — see [Smart Meter Data Exchange](../use-cases/smart-meter-data-exchange/README.md).

## What's Different From Other Credentials

`CustomerCredential` and `ConsumerEnergyPassport` attest to **slow-changing facts** about the meter and its assets. The Meter Digest attests to **a snapshot of readings**. Implications:

| Concern | Customer / Passport credentials | Consumer Meter Digest |
|---|---|---|
| Issued | Once at onboarding; re-issued on material change | On consumer demand, freshly each time |
| Lifespan (`validUntil`) | Years | Hours to days — readings are a point-in-time snapshot |
| Revocation | Common (asset change, disconnection) | Rare — Digests typically expire faster than they would need revocation |
| Holder action | Passive (issued and pushed) | **Active** (consumer requests it for a specific period) |
| Content | Slow-changing identity & asset facts | Time-bounded readings or derived summaries |

A DISCOM that already runs OpenCred for the other two credentials issues Digests from the same instance — only the schema, the trigger, and the short `validUntil` differ.

---

## Common Envelope

Same as [`CustomerCredential`](./schemas.md#common-envelope). The `type` array carries `"ConsumerMeterDigest"`:

```json
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "ConsumerMeterDigest"]
```

`validFrom` is the issuance time; `validUntil` is typically `validFrom + 24h` to `validFrom + 7d` depending on the use case (loan applications often want fresh; subsidy portals tolerate a week).

### meterReference (required)

Links the Digest unambiguously to the meter and the issuing DISCOM.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `meterNumber` | string | ✓ | Unique meter serial number |
| `customerNumber` | string | ✓ | Consumer account number from DISCOM CIS |
| `discomId` | URI | ✓ | Issuing DISCOM `did:web` — must equal `issuer.id` |
| `meterType` | enum | ✓ | Same enumeration as `customerProfile.meterType` |

### period (required)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `start` | date-time | ✓ | ISO 8601 start of the readings range, with timezone offset |
| `end` | date-time | ✓ | ISO 8601 end of the range (exclusive) |

### granularity (required)

Enum:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `RAW_15M` | Raw 15-minute readings — `readings` block carries the OpenADR `REPORT` |
| `RAW_30M` | Raw 30-minute readings |
| `DAILY` | Daily totals — `readings` block carries `PT24H` intervals |
| `MONTHLY` | Monthly totals — `readings` block carries `P1M` intervals |
| `SUMMARY_MONTHLY_LADDER` | Per-month total kWh + per-month bill — `summary` block populated |
| `SUMMARY_TOD_PROFILE` | Average kWh per hour-of-day across the period — `summary` block populated |
| `SUMMARY_PEAK_DEMAND` | Peak kW per month with timestamps — `summary` block populated |

### readings

When `granularity` ∈ `RAW_15M / RAW_30M / DAILY / MONTHLY`, the `readings` block carries the matching [`MeterData`](../schemas/MeterData/README.md) profile (`INTERVAL` / `DAILY` / `MONTHLY`) covering the requested period. Same shape as [Smart Meter Data Exchange](../use-cases/smart-meter-data-exchange/README.md#the-dataset--meterdatav06).

### summary

When `granularity` ∈ `SUMMARY_*`, the `summary` block carries the derived aggregate. Field shape varies by summary type:

```json
"summary": {
  "type": "SUMMARY_MONTHLY_LADDER",
  "rows": [
    { "month": "2025-06", "kwh": 412, "billINR": 3185 },
    { "month": "2025-07", "kwh": 478, "billINR": 3942 }
    /* ... */
  ]
}
```

```json
"summary": {
  "type": "SUMMARY_TOD_PROFILE",
  "intervals": [
    { "hour": 0,  "avgKwh": 0.18 },
    { "hour": 1,  "avgKwh": 0.16 },
    /* ... 24 entries ... */
    { "hour": 19, "avgKwh": 0.94 }
  ]
}
```

### dataQuality (required)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `coveragePercent` | number | ✓ | % of expected intervals that have a reading (100 = no gaps) |
| `estimatedPercent` | number | ✓ | % of returned intervals flagged `ESTIMATED` |
| `flags` | string[] | | Free-form quality flags (`"meter-replaced-mid-period"`, `"clock-skew-2025-08"`) |

A verifier can reject a Digest with low coverage or high estimation without inspecting the readings themselves.

## Issuing the Digest

Issuance is on demand: the consumer's wallet sends a Beckn `confirm` to the DISCOM's BPP, the BPP authorises the request against the consumer's `CustomerCredential` or `ConsumerEnergyPassport` presentation, queries MDMS for the period, and calls OpenCred to mint the Digest.

The OpenCred call mirrors the [`CustomerCredential` issuance flow](./issuance.md) with:

1. `type: ["VerifiableCredential", "ConsumerMeterDigest"]`
2. `credentialSubject.id` set to the consumer DID extracted from the inbound presentation
3. A short `validUntil` (1d–7d depending on policy)
4. The MDMS-derived `meterReference`/`period`/`granularity`/`readings`-or-`summary`/`dataQuality` block

Until the canonical schema files land alongside [`/schemas/ElectricityCredential/v1.0/`](../schemas/ElectricityCredential/v1.0/README.md), pass `inlineSchema` to OpenCred derived from this page.

Use `proofFormat: "vc-jwt"` (the bootcamp default since OpenCred PR #599) for the Digest. Revocations are rare in practice — Digests are usually short-lived enough to expire before any revoke would matter — but when a revoke is needed, pass an optional `reason` such as `"data-correction"` or `"holder-request"` on `POST /v1/credentials/revoke`; see [Issuance → revoking](./issuance.md#publish-the-revocation).

---

## Verifying the Digest

Same flow as [Verification](./verification.md):

1. Resolve the DISCOM's `did:web` (directly over HTTPS from `.well-known/did.json`) and the regulator quoted in `issuer.idRef`.
2. Verify the `proof` signature locally.
3. Check `credentialStatus` against DeDi for revocation.
4. Confirm `validUntil` is in the future.
5. Read `dataQuality.coveragePercent` and `dataQuality.estimatedPercent` against the verifier's tolerance threshold.
6. Read `readings` or `summary` and proceed.
